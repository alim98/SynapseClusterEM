# Synapse Visualization Enhancements Documentation

## Overview

We have implemented several significant enhancements to the synapse visualization system to improve feature extraction and analysis. These enhancements include intelligent cropping functionality, improved visualization techniques, and better comparative analysis tools.

## 1. Intelligent Cropping Functionality

### Purpose
The original system cropped synapses based solely on the center of the cleft. The new intelligent cropping considers both the cleft and presynapse position, which is crucial for effective feature extraction.

### Implementation Details
- **Smart Crop Parameter**: Added a `smart_crop` boolean parameter to enable/disable intelligent cropping
- **Presynapse Weight Parameter**: Added a `presynapse_weight` parameter (range 0.0-1.0) to control how much the bounding box is shifted toward the presynapse
- **Center Point Calculation**: Implemented a weighted average between the original cleft center and the presynapse center of mass
- **Shift Vector Reporting**: Added logging and visualization of the calculated shift vector

### Benefits
- Better capture of presynaptic features
- Ensures the cleft remains within the bounding box
- Configurable via weight parameter to adjust for different analysis needs

## 2. Visualization Improvements

### Purpose
Enhanced the visual representation to make comparisons clearer and more informative.

### Implementation Details
- **Improved Layout**:
  - Added margins between images
  - Created header space for better title display
  - Added separator lines between panels
  - Used consistent background colors

- **Text Enhancements**:
  - Centered titles over respective images
  - Added text outlines for better visibility
  - Truncated long titles with ellipsis when necessary
  - Added frame counters for animation progress

- **Consistent Grayscale**:
  - Implemented global normalization across all frames
  - Eliminated per-slice normalization that caused inconsistent gray values
  - Applied consistent scaling based on volume-wide min/max values

### Benefits
- More professional and readable visualizations
- Consistent appearance across all frames
- Better visual comparison between standard and intelligent cropping

## 3. Multi-Weight Comparison Tool

### Purpose
Created a tool to directly compare the effects of different presynapse weights.

### Implementation Details
- **Multi-Panel Display**:
  - Created a new function `create_multi_weight_comparison`
  - Shows standard cropping alongside multiple weight options in a single GIF
  - Dynamically arranges panels based on available weights

- **Automatic Processing**:
  - Tracks generated GIFs for each weight
  - Creates combined comparison automatically

- **Visual Metadata**:
  - Weight value labeled on each panel
  - Sample information displayed in header
  - Frame counter included for reference

### Benefits
- Direct visual comparison of different weight settings
- Easier parameter tuning
- Better understanding of how weight affects the cropping behavior

## 4. Performance and Quality Improvements

### Purpose
Enhanced the overall quality and user experience.

### Implementation Details
- **Frame Rate Adjustment**:
  - Reduced FPS from 10 to 8 for better visualization
  - Makes it easier to observe details in the animations

- **Error Handling**:
  - Added comprehensive error logging
  - Created fallbacks for font loading
  - Included detailed exception reporting

- **Metadata Generation**:
  - Created companion info files with detailed parameters
  - Logged shift vectors and other key metrics
  - Included range information for post-analysis

### Benefits
- More stable and reliable visualization process
- Better documentation of parameters for reproducibility
- Enhanced user experience when viewing the GIFs

## 5. Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- `create_segmented_cube`: Modified to support intelligent cropping
- `visualize_comparison`: Enhanced for better visualization and metadata
- `create_combined_frames`: Improved layout and appearance
- `create_multi_weight_comparison`: New function for multi-weight comparison
- `main`: Updated to orchestrate the generation of all comparison types

### Workflow
1. Load volume data and synapse information
2. Generate standard and intelligent crop cubes
3. Process frames with consistent normalization
4. Create comparison visualizations
5. Generate multi-weight comparisons
6. Save detailed metadata for analysis

## Usage Examples

### Running Basic Comparison
```python
python -m newdl.sample_fig_compare_crop
```

### Modifying Presynapse Weights
To experiment with different weight values, modify the following line in the main function:
```python
presynapse_weights = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]  # Different weights to compare
```

### Output Files
The script generates the following types of output files:
- `bbox_name_var1_standard.gif` - Standard cropping
- `bbox_name_var1_intelligent_w{weight}.gif` - Intelligent cropping with specific weight
- `bbox_name_var1_comparison_w{weight}.gif` - Side-by-side comparison
- `bbox_name_var1_multi_weight_comparison.gif` - Multi-weight comparison
- `bbox_name_var1_info.txt` - Metadata about the comparison

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the functionality and usability of the synapse visualization system. The intelligent cropping provides better feature extraction by considering presynapse positioning, while the improved visualization tools make it easier to analyze and compare different cropping strategies. The multi-weight comparison offers a powerful way to tune parameters and understand the impact of different settings.
