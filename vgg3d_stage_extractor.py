class VGG3DStageExtractor:
    """
    A high-level interface for extracting features from specific stages of the VGG3D model.
    
    This class allows extracting features from different stages of the VGG3D model
    without having to implement any methods. Users should implement the necessary
    functionality in their own code.
    
    Usage example:
    -------------
    extractor = VGG3DStageExtractor(model)
    stage1_features = extractor.extract_stage(1, input_tensor)
    stage2_features = extractor.extract_stage(2, input_tensor)
    """

        """
        Initialize the VGG3DStageExtractor with a VGG3D model.
        
        Args:
            model: A VGG3D model instance

        pass
    
    def extract_stage(self, stage_number, inputs):
